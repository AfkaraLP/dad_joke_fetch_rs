# why is this public?

idk tbh I think I lost it 

oh yeah to run it use 
```bash
# install wasm32 to use with trunk
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# install trunk 
cargo install --locked trunk

# run the app on the port configured in Trunk.toml
trunk serve
```

read the [Yew Page](https://yew.rs/docs/getting-started/introduction) for more info 

(you'll need rust obviously)
